"""# Q4. There are total n number of Monkeys sitting on the branches of a huge Tree. 
# As travelers offer Bananas and Peanuts, the Monkeys jump down the Tree. If every Monkey can eat k Bananas and j Peanuts. 
# If total m number of Bananas and p number of Peanuts are offered by travelers, calculate how many Monkeys remain on the Tree after some of them jumped down to eat. 
# At a time one Monkeys gets down and finishes eating and go to the other side of the road. 
# The Monkey who climbed down does not climb up again after eating until the other Monkeys finish eating.
# Monkey can either eat k Bananas or j Peanuts. If for last Monkey there are less than k Bananas left on the ground or less 
# than j Peanuts left on the ground, only that Monkey can eat Bananas(<k) along with the Peanuts(<j).
# Write code to take inputs as n, m, p, k, j and return the number of Monkeys left on the Tree.
# Where, n= Total no of Monkeys
# k= Number of eatable Bananas by Single Monkey (Monkey that jumped down last may get less than k Bananas)
# j = Number of eatable Peanuts by single Monkey (Monkey that jumped down last may get less than j Peanuts)
# m = Total number of Bananas
# p = Total number of Peanuts
# Remember that the Monkeys always eat Bananas and Peanuts, so there is no possibility of k and j having a value zero """
